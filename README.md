### Persistent Settings Across Sessions
The Godblessed Map Generator mod saves your preferred map generation settings, so they’re ready to go every time you jump into a Planetary Annihilation: TITANS lobby. No need to reselect your options for each match—your choices are stored between sessions, letting you quickly set up the perfect planet and get straight to the action.

### Customizable Biome Selection
Choose from seven distinct biomes to shape the battlefield right in the lobby before the match begins. From volcanic wastelands to verdant jungles, each biome offers a unique vibe and strategic flavor. Feeling adventurous? Opt for the random biome setting to let the mod surprise you with a fresh planet every time.

### Adjustable Planet Sizes
Define the scale of your match with three planet size options: small, medium, or gigantic. Set up compact arenas for intense, fast-paced clashes or massive worlds for sprawling galactic wars—all from the lobby in seconds, giving you full control over the scope of your next battle.

### Configurable Planet Wealth
Decide how resource-rich your planet will be with three wealth levels: poor, average, or rich. This feature lets you customize the economic stakes of the match directly in the lobby, whether you want a resource-tight duel that demands careful planning or a bountiful world for rapid expansion and all-out warfare.
